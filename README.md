<h2> A mandatory sea shanty üòÑ</h2>
<pre>
Oh, I had a dream one night so bold,
Of running systems, stories untold,
Windows, Linux, macOS so fine,
On my personal machine, a dream of mine.

Sailing 'cross the digital sea,
A tech adventure, wild and free,
But obstacles came, tried to dismay,
Yet heroes arose to pave the way.

Apple's Silicon, a mighty tide,
Swept away hopes, left me in a stride,
No AMD iGPU love to be found,
In macOS land, my dreams near drowned.

Sailing 'cross the digital sea,
A tech adventure, wild and free,
But heroes emerged, determined and bright,
@NootedRed crew, in the heart of the fight.

With skill and code, they labored long,
To create a kext, to right the wrong,
A working display, for AMD's might,
In macOS realm, they shed the light.

Sailing 'cross the digital sea,
A tech adventure, wild and free,
@NootedRed crew, with talents so vast,
They brought my dream, from shadows to cast.

Armed with the kext, I sailed ahead,
Onward I pushed, no challenge I'd dread,
A macOS laptop, complete and grand,
Most functions alive, across the land.

Sailing 'cross the digital sea,
A tech adventure, wild and free,
Though dGPU's absence brings a sigh,
My dream's alive, reaching for the sky.

So here's to dreamers and to those who strive,
To make the impossible come alive,
Through challenges faced and barriers crossed,
Tech's brave pioneers, no matter the cost.

<b> TLDR: Silicon dreams sailed,  NootedRed's light pierced the storm,  Mac's realm, AMD's form.</b>
